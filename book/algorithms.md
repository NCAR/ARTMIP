# Algorithms
#### Listed algorithms (A1, A2, etc.) have submitted catalogues for Tier 1. Algorithm numbering is determined by overall alphabetical order with the first set of numbers assigned to developers who participated in the 1-month proof of concept (A1 â€“ A15), see [GMD paper](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/11/2455/2018/gmd-11-2455-2018.pdf), followed by Tier 1-only participation (A16-39).
