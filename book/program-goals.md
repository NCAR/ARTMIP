# Program Goals
#### ARTMIP will benefit the atmospheric river scientific community, most directly weather and climate modelers. A catalogue of ARs and AR-related information will enable researchers to assess which identification methods are most appropriate for the science question being asked, or region of interest. Guidance on identifying ARs will provide for a set of best practices and community standards that researchers can work with and use to develop diagnostic and evaluation metrics for models and observational products.
## Goal 1
* Provide a framework that allows for a systematic comparison of how different AR identification methods affect the climatological, hydrological, and extreme impacts attributed to ARs.
## Goal 2
* Understand and quantify the differences and uncertainties in the climatological characteristics of ARs, as a result of different AR identification methods.
## Goal 3
* Better understand changes in future ARs and AR-related impacts.
