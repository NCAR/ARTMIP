### 1<sup>st</sup> ARTMIP Workshop
**Date**: 10 - 11 May 2017

**Location**: Scripps Institute of Oceanography

**Goals**
* To create ARTMIP framework
* Choose common data set for initial catalogues
* Gain community input on key science questions
* Gain community input on AR metrics for ARTMIP

**Outcomes**
<ul>
  <li>Tier structure established</li>
  <li>Chose MERRA-2 1980-2017 for Tier 1 catalogues</li>
  <li>Designed a 1-month “proof of concept” trial run to work out bugs with Tier 1 design. February 2017 was chosen due to high AR frequency in PNW during this time period</li>
  <li>Chose CAM5 25km LLBL climate change runs for Tier 2 climate catalogues</li>
  <li>Key science questions are related to:</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Uncertainty regarding AR climatology</li>
    <li>The relationship between ARs and precipitation</li>
    <li>How these may be altered under future climate change scenarios</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Fundamental metrics include AR frequency, duration, intensity, and the climatology of these quantities</li>
  <li>Co-chairs will lead two papers:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Outlining experimental design</li>
    <li>Scientific results from Tier 1</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
